Linus Benedict Torvalds
(bottom)
is a Finnish–American software engineer who is the creator, and historically,
the principal developer of the Linux kernel, which became the kernel for many 
Linux distributions and operating systems such as Android and Chrome OS. 
He also created the distributed version control system Git and the diving 
logging and planning software Subsurface.
(bottom)
He was honored, with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology 
Academy Finland "in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating 
system for computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel". He is also the 
recipient of the 2014 IEEE Computer Society’s Computer Pioneer Award and the 
2018 IEEE Masaru Ibuka Consumer Electronics Award.

LINUX KERNEL
(bottom)

The Linux kernel is a free and open-source, monolithic, Unix-like operating system kernel.
The Linux family of operating systems is based on this kernel and deployed on both traditional
computer systems such as personal computers and servers, usually in the form of Linux 
distributions, and on various embedded devices such as routers, wireless access points,
PBXes, set-top boxes, FTA receivers, smart TVs, PVRs, and NAS appliances. While the adoption 
of the Linux kernel in desktop computer operating system is low, Linux-based operating systems 
dominate nearly every other segment of computing, from mobile devices to mainframes.

As of November 2018, all of the world's 500 most powerful supercomputers run Linux. 
The Android operating system for tablet computers, smartphones, and smartwatches also
uses the Linux kernel.

The Linux kernel was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his personal computer 
and with no cross-platform intentions, but has since expanded to support a huge array of 
computer architectures, many more than other operating systems or kernels. Linux rapidly 
attracted developers and users who adopted it as the kernel for other free software projects,
notably the GNU Operating System
(bottom)
The Linux kernel, developed by contributors worldwide, is a prominent example of free and open
source software. Day-to-day development discussions take place on the Linux kernel mailing list.
The Linux kernel is released under the GNU General Public License version 2, with some firmware
images released under various non-free licenses.

The Linux kernel is written in the version of the C programming language supported by GCC , 
together with a number of short sections of code written in the assembly language of the 
target architecture. Because of the extensions to C it supports, GCC was for a long time 
the only compiler capable of correctly building the Linux kernel.
The Linux kernel development community uses Git to manage the kernel source code. 
Linus Torvalds initially developed this version control system with speed in mind and 
as a distributed system.

All the Linux distributions are either derivative of GNU/Linux or derived from other 
Linux derivatives.
Desktop distributions comes with Graphical user interface enabled by default &   
aimed at individual users and most of the administration work can be done using GUI. 
ood for new users and running Linux-based graphical applications.

here are examples:

Linux Shell
Linux's shell is its main part. Its distros come in GUI, but basically, Linux has a CLI . 
We are going to cover the basic commands that we use in the shell of Linux.
(bottom)

When you first open the terminal, you are in the home directory of your user. 
To know which directory you are in, you can use the “pwd” command. It gives us the 
absolute path, which means the path that starts from the root.
(bottom)

Use the "ls" command to know what files are in the directory you are in. 
You can see all the hidden files by using the command “ls -a”.
(bottom)
Use the "cd" command to go to a directory. For example, if you are in 
the home folder, and you want to go to the downloads folder, then you 
can type in “cd Downloads”.
(bottom)

Use the mkdir command when you need to create a folder or a directory. 
Use rmdir to delete a directory. But rmdir can only be used to delete
an empty directory. To delete a directory containing files, use rm.
(bottom)
Use the rm command to delete files and directories.  Use "rm -r" to delete 
just the directory. It deletes both the folder and the files it contains when
using only the rm command
(bottom)

 The touch command is used to create a file. It can be anything, from an empty 
 txt file to an empty zip file. For example, “touch new.txt”
